## Project Description

**Rendezvous** is a social planning app designed for university students and young adults who love going out with friends but struggle with the *“Where should we go?”* dilemma.  
Instead of relying on endless group chats and scattered social media saves, Rendezvous offers a shared, centralized bucket list where friends can add cafes, restaurants, and activities they find online. When a user finds a new spot they like, they can add it directly into the app. The app then uses AI extraction tools to automatically pull key info such as name, cost, type of activity, etc.

When it’s time to hang out, users can:
- **Filter activities** by location, budget, category, etc.  
- **Let the app decide** through fun features like a wheel spin or card draw  
- **Record memories** by marking outings as “done” and adding photos and captions

Rendezvous is built to make social planning smoother, quicker, and more fun by helping friend groups spend less time deciding and more time experiencing.

## Project History

The idea for **rendezvous** came from our own experiences as university students constantly trying to plan group outings. We noticed that group chats were full of “we should go here!” messages, but when the time came, no one could remember where or decide on a plan. This frustration inspired us to design a system that organizes shared ideas into a practical, fun tool for decision-making.
